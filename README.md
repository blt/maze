# A LOVE maze runner game

You are the intrepid golden square, making your way from the green square to the
red. You'll have to navigate a nearly monochrome labyrinth--gasp! the walls are
grey--to receive the ultimate reward: complete annihilation of yourself and the
world!

## About this Game

It's a weekend hack done up in [LOVE](http://love2d.org), which I wasn't
familiar with before sitting down to write the game. There are probably thing
that could be done better, but:

* the mazes take a while to get through (fun!)
* I'll eagerly accept patches and
* you get to play a world-destroying golden square!

I mean, who can resist that last point there?

## Installation

Er, hmm. You will need the `love` executable in your path. I developed with
0.8.0 tip--owing to my crummy integrated Intel video card having difficulty
rendering straight lines with 0.7.1--and didn't check to see that the game would
work on any other version. Sorry!

To run, from the root of this project:

    $ love .

Wait a minute as the maze is generated, then begin you mad dash to utter
oblivion!
